A performance-oriented, "freeze-proof" scheduler that provides a priority-based task system to prevent UI blocking. It intelligently uses `requestAnimationFrame` for high-priority tasks and `requestIdleCallback` for non-essential background work.

---

### The Problem

Complex web applications can fire hundreds of `setTimeout` calls, blocking the browser's main thread and leading to a frozen UI, janky animations, and a poor user experience. Not all tasks are equally important, but the browser treats them the same, executing a non-critical analytics event with the same urgency as a UI update.

### The Solution

`@artesoft/timeout-scheduler` solves this by intercepting `setTimeout` and providing a priority-aware task queue.

-   **High-priority tasks** (e.g., UI updates) are processed smoothly using `requestAnimationFrame`, ensuring your application remains responsive.
-   **Low-priority tasks** (e.g., logging, non-essential data processing) are deferred to `requestIdleCallback`, allowing the browser to execute them during periods of inactivity, guaranteeing zero impact on performance.

## Features

-   **Prevents UI Freezing:** Batches `setTimeout` callbacks to run smoothly over time.
-   **ðŸš€ Cooperative Scheduling:** Uses `requestIdleCallback` for low-priority tasks to run work only when the browser is idle.
-   **Task Prioritization:** A new `scheduleTask` API lets you distinguish between `'user-visible'` and `'background'` work.
-   **Dynamic Performance Tuning:** Automatically adjusts how many tasks run per frame based on main thread performance.
-   **Drop-in Replacement:** The `overrideTimeouts()` method works without refactoring your existing `setTimeout` calls.
-   **Graceful Shutdown:** Pending tasks are never lost and are rescheduled with native `setTimeout` on cleanup.
-   **Highly Configurable:** Fine-tune the scheduling behavior, enable dynamic budgeting, and turn on logging.
-   **Framework-Agnostic:** Works with any frontend framework or vanilla JavaScript.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @artesoft/timeout-scheduler rxjs
```

## How to Use

### Basic Usage (Drop-in)

For instant benefits, simply initialize the scheduler and override the global `setTimeout`. All existing calls will be treated as high-priority and managed smoothly.

```typescript
import { TimeoutScheduler } from '@artesoft/timeout-scheduler';

const scheduler = new TimeoutScheduler({ loggingEnabled: true });
scheduler.overrideTimeouts();

// This is now managed by the scheduler and won't block the UI.
setTimeout(() => console.log('This is a user-visible task!'), 100);```

### Advanced Usage with Task Priorities

Use the `scheduleTask` method to leverage the full power of cooperative scheduling.

```typescript
import { TimeoutScheduler } from '@artesoft/timeout-scheduler';

const scheduler = new TimeoutScheduler({ loggingEnabled: true });

// High-priority task: Renders an important UI element.
// Will use requestAnimationFrame.
scheduler.scheduleTask(() => {
  document.getElementById('root').innerHTML = 'UI Updated!';
}, { delay: 100, priority: 'user-visible' });

// Low-priority task: Send analytics data.
// Will use requestIdleCallback and only run when the browser is idle.
scheduler.scheduleTask(() => {
  fetch('/api/analytics', { method: 'POST', body: '{}' });
}, { delay: 500, priority: 'background' });
```

## API Reference

### `new TimeoutScheduler(config?)`

Creates a new scheduler instance.
- `config` (optional): `SchedulerConfig` object.
  - `initialTasksPerFrame?: number` (Default: `50`)
  - `loggingEnabled?: boolean` (Default: `false`)
  - `runInBackground?: boolean` (Default: `false`)
  - `dynamicBudgetEnabled?: boolean` (Default: `true`)
  - `frameTimeBudgetMs?: number` (Default: `8`)
  - `maxTasksPerFrame?: number` (Default: `150`)

### `.scheduleTask(callback, options?)`

Schedules a task with a given priority. This is the preferred API for new code.
- `callback: (...args: any[]) => void`
- `options?: TaskOptions`
  - `delay?: number` (Default: `0`)
  - `priority?: 'user-visible' | 'background'` (Default: `'user-visible'`)

### `.overrideTimeouts()`

Replaces `window.setTimeout` and `window.clearTimeout`. All tasks scheduled via this method are assigned `'user-visible'` priority.

### `.restoreTimeouts()`

Restores the original `window.setTimeout` and `window.clearTimeout` functions and reschedules any pending tasks.

### `.destroy()`

A complete cleanup method. It calls `restoreTimeouts()` and completes observables to prevent memory leaks.

### `pendingTaskCount$`

An RxJS `Observable<number>` that emits the current number of tasks in the queue.
